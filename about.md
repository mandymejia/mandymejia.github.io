I am an associate professor in the Department of Statistics at Indiana University, where I lead the Statistical Methods for Individualized Neuro-Discovery (StatMIND) Lab. My group develops and applies statistical methods for functional neuroimaging data, with an eye to individualized modeling and clinical translation. Developing open-source user-friendly software is a big focus of the lab. Learn more at [statmindlab.com](https://www.statmindlab.com/).    

My work is supported by grants from NIH, NSF, and a Women in STEM2D fellowship from Johnson & Johnson. I work closely with engineers, neuroscientists, psychologists, physicists and clinicians, as well as other statisticians and data scientists. These days I am excited about: fMRI-based biomarker development for Alzheimer's, data-driven hemodynamic response function modeling, scrubbing, harmonization, brain network mapping with Bayesian models, and fast spatial Bayesian modeling for fMRI.  To learn about opportunities to join the lab, visit [statmindlab.com/join-us](https://www.statmindlab.com/join-us) or shoot me an email at [afmejia at iu dot edu]. 

Through this blog, I reflect on questions and challenges that come up in my research in neuroimaging statistics.  I share insights, tools, tips and knowledge that I hope will be of use to others.
