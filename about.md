I am an associate professor in the Department of Statistics at Indiana University, where I lead the Statistical Methods for Individualized Neuro-Discovery (StatMIND) Lab.  Learn more about the lab's work at [statmindlab.com](https://www.statmindlab.com/), where you can also access my CV and links to software packages.  My work is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and a Women in STEM2D fellowship from Johnson & Johnson.  

Through this blog, I reflect on questions and challenges that come up in my research in neuroimaging statistics.  I share insights, tools and knowledge relevant to the analysis of neuroimaging data, which I hope will be of use to others.

I am currently (Spring 2024) on sabbatical at the National University of Singapore.
