I am an associate professor in the Department of Statistics at Indiana University, where I lead the Statistical Methods for Individualized Neuro-Discovery (StatMIND) Lab.  Learn more about the lab's work at [statmindlab.com](https://www.statmindlab.com/), where you can also access my CV and a list of recent publications.  My work is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and a Women in STEM2D fellowship from Johnson & Johnson.  

Through this blog, I reflect on topics related to my research in neuroimaging statistics. My hope is to share tools and insights for the statistical analysis of functional MRI that may be of use to others.

I am currently (Spring 2024) on sabbatical at the National University of Singapore.
