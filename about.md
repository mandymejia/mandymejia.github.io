I am an associate professor in the Department of Statistics at Indiana University, where I lead the Statistical Methods for Individualized Neuro-Discovery (StatMIND) Lab.  Learn more about the lab's work at [statmindlab.com](https://www.statmindlab.com/), where you can also access my CV and a list of recent publications.  

I am currently (Spring 2024) on sabbatical at the National University of Singapore.
