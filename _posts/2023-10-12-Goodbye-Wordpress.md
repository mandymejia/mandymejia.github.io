I am transitioning my personal website and blog from being hosted on Wordpress to Github pages.  I'll be transporting existing posts over before adding one or two new ones.  I'm excited to start [blogging like a hacker](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) using Markdown and Github with Jekyll!
